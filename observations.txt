parta:
	process appears to become a zombie. I kind of though ttha tmight happen, but was suprised that we were told to do this without instructions on how to handle it
partb:
	Processes run simulatiously so really only the last process has any say on what happens.
partc:
	Without the wait threads finish fast enough you get the correct resulting count. This isn't garenteed but seems to work on my system.
partd:
	With mutex the process waitsd as it should to get things done. Returns the proper count.
