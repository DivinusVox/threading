parta:
	Process appears to become a zombie. I kind of thought that might happen, but was surprised that we were told to do this without instructions on how to handle it.
partb:
	Processes run simultaneously so really only the last process has any say on what happens.
partc:
	Without the wait threads finish fast enough you get the correct resulting count. This isn't guaranteed but seems to work on my system.
partd:
	With mutex the process waits as it should to get things done. Returns the proper count.
